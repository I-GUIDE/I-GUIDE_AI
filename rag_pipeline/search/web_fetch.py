"""Open-web page fetch: the EXPENSIVE read stage, gated by a request-forgery guard.

``web_search`` finds candidate pages cheaply (metadata only). This module is what actually reads
one, and it is the step that has to be defended, because the URL is chosen by an LLM that may
have just read an attacker-controlled page. A server-side fetcher that will retrieve any URL it
is handed is a request-forgery primitive pointed at this deployment's private network — the
embedding server, Neo4j, OpenSearch, the MCP server, and the cloud metadata endpoint are all
reachable from the agent container.

Three defences, in order of importance:

1. **Resolve, then classify the ADDRESS — never the hostname string.** Checking the name is what
   lets ``http://127.1/`` and ``http://2130706433/`` through; both were verified on this platform
   to resolve straight to 127.0.0.1, so classifying the resolved address handles every alternate
   encoding for free. Every address the resolver returns must pass, not just the first.
2. **Re-validate on EVERY redirect hop.** Validating only the initial URL is the classic bypass:
   a public host answers 302 with ``Location: http://169.254.169.254/``. Redirects are therefore
   followed manually with ``allow_redirects=False``.
3. **Bound the cost while streaming**, so a hostile or merely huge response cannot be pulled into
   memory before anyone looks at its size.

Content is then reduced to on-topic passages rather than whole pages. That is the same idea as the
snippet stage — pay for what answers the question, not for navigation chrome.
