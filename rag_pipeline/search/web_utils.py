"""Shared plumbing for open-web search and fetch: caps, the hit envelope, and the per-turn budget.

Web access differs from every other retrieval path in this service in one way that matters: the
content is UNBOUNDED. A catalog connector returns a bounded record; a web page can be 400 KB of
navigation chrome, and a search engine will happily return ten of them. The efficient agents do
not solve that with a re-ranker after the fact — they keep the expensive operation (reading a
page) behind a cheap one (reading a snippet) and cap both in CODE rather than in the prompt.

This module holds the parts both stages need:

* ``WebHit`` — the metadata-only envelope a search returns. Deliberately has NO body field: a
  search result must not be able to smuggle page content into the model's context.
* the caps (env-tunable), so a turn cannot silently spend unbounded time or tokens on the network;
* the per-turn LEDGER, which counts searches/fetches and records every URL the run actually
  touched. That URL list is what lets the answer sanitizer distinguish a real source from a
  fabricated one — the failure mode this service has already been bitten by twice.
