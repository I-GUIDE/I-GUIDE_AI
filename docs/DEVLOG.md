# Development log — extraction restructure → deployable beta

One entry per step, appended in the **same commit** as the change it describes.
Plan: `~/.claude/plans/based-on-our-discussion-lazy-cray.md`.

Entry format:

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD · <milestone id> · <short title>
**Change** what changed, with file:line
**Why** what was wrong before — the defect, not the intention
**Measured** the number that moved: before -> after
**Surprised by** anything the change revealed that we did not expect (omit if nothing)
**Next** what this unblocks or what it forces
```

`Measured` makes each milestone's exit criterion auditable. `Surprised by` is where
findings get captured before they are forgotten — it is also the raw material for the
SIGSPATIAL methods and results sections.

Every LLM-touching entry records the model used. A recall number produced under `opus`
is not comparable to one produced under a self-hosted 7B.

---

## 2026-08-07 · M0.1 · Baseline measured before any change

**Change** Added this log. No code touched.

**Why** The plan's exit criteria are all expressed as numbers that must move. Those
numbers are worthless without a recorded starting point, and several of them were
measured during planning against live infrastructure that will drift.

**Measured** — baseline, all verified directly rather than inferred:

*Corpus and retrieval*
- `new-opensearch-index`: **619 docs** — publication 180, map 160, notebook 133,
  dataset 87, oer 32, code 27.
- Live platform catalog (`backend.i-guide.io/api/elements`): **750 elements**. The
  index is therefore **131 elements (17%) stale**. `iguide-feb12` exists on the
  cluster and is fresher.
- BM25 recall over the benchmark's **full** expected sets (37 ids across 11 tasks),
  each task's verbatim prompt as the query:
  | k | recall |
  |---|---|
  | 8 (current effective window) | **22/37 (59%)** |
  | 20 | **29/37 (78%)** |
  | 50 | 33/37 (89%) |
  | 100 | 34/37 (92%) |
- Three expected elements are unreachable by BM25 at **any** k — `afbee4bd` (T6,
  Open-Meteo notebook), `643aaea1` (T9), `de05a428` (T10). These are genuine indexing
  gaps, not window problems.
- Per-task at k=8 → k=20: T8 **3/7 → 7/7**, T7 1/3 → 2/3, T5 2/3 → 3/3, T1 2/3 → 2/3.
- Semantic search was **not** exercised: `FLASK_EMBEDDING_URL` in `.env` points at
  `149.165.159.254:5000`, which refuses connections. All figures above are BM25 only,
  so the real ceiling is higher.

*Agent-side*
- `iguide_agent_*` indices on the live cluster: **0 of 4 exist**.
- Agent KB: **290 blocks from 14 of 133 notebooks (10.5%)**, in a single local JSON at
  `agent_chat_files/agent_kb/iguide_agent_notebook_blocks.json`.
- Publications with reachable full text (`pdf_chunks`): **34 of 180**, and **no search
  tool queries them**.
- `opengeodata_search` calls across 11 recorded eval runs: **0**.
- MCP tools reaching a model in a default supervisor run: **4** of 16 native
  (`default_search_fn` defaults `include_mcp_tools=False` at `supervisor/graph.py:1428`;
  `default_analyze_fn` scopes to `spatial_analysis_tools` at `:1658`).

*Quality gates*
- Tests importing anything from `extractors/` or the emitters: **0**, across ~3,250 LOC.
- `_AUDIT_FLAG_SEVERITIES = {"high"}` (`supervisor/graph.py:418`); severities emitted
  across the 11 committed eval records are `low` ×4 and `none` ×40 — so the user-visible
  caveat never fired **on that corpus**, and "0 hallucinations in 21 runs" is the null
  output of a detector that never triggered there.
  > ⚠️ **REFINED (see M0.2b):** this must not be read as "the caveat cannot fire." Driving
  > the prototype live produced a `severity: high` caveat on the very first substantive
  > query — and it was a **false positive**. Scope the claim to the recorded corpus.
- `retrieval_success` is pinned at **10/10** by construction: `scripts/eval_common.py`
  scores it against `TASK_META[tid]["primary_ids"]` (a subset) while computing
  `full_exp` on the line above.
- Dev/prod dependency drift: dev runs langchain **1.2.10** / core **1.4.9** / langgraph
  **1.0.10**; `pip install --dry-run -r requirements.txt` resolves to
  **1.3.14 / 1.5.3 / 1.2.10**. The unbounded `>=1.0` pins are real and confirmed by the
  resolver report.
  > ⚠️ **RETRACTED (see M0.5):** this entry originally claimed "repo suite against the
  > prod-resolved set: 550 passed, 9 failed". That measurement was invalid — the venv it
  > ran in had no `pyvenv.cfg`, `sys.prefix` was `/opt/anaconda3`, and its interpreter
  > resolved langchain from `~/.local` at **1.2.10**. It measured the dev stack, not the
  > prod stack. M0.5 re-measures with a verified-isolated venv.

*Execution*
- Sandbox: `python:3.11-slim`, **512m / 1.0 cpu / 60s / 256 pids**, `--network none`.
- Workspace lifetime: **destroyed after every call** —
  `code_execution.py:279` `tempfile.mkdtemp()` and `:309` `shutil.rmtree(work)` in a
  `finally`. Step 2 cannot read step 1's output.
- Median recorded turn: **37s** (range 12–232s).

*Access*
- Reachable: platform API, OpenSearch, GitHub raw (8/12 notebooks on a naive
  `main`/`master` probe), MinIO `storage-dev.i-guide.io` (200).
- Not reachable from a dev machine: Neo4j `10.0.147.52:7687` (private subnet), the
  embedding server (stale `.env` host).

**Surprised by** Two findings inverted planned work. (1) `AGENT_ALLOW_WORKFLOW_EXEC=1`
routes ingested third-party notebook source into a bare
`exec(compile(...), namespace, namespace)` **in the MCP server process**
(`MCP_server/tools/generated_notebook_tools.py:43-47`), which has network, the shared
`agent_chat_files` volume, and cluster credentials — so the flag stays `0` and the
`mcp_run_nbwf_*` path gets deleted rather than enabled. (2) The prod mapping for
`spatial-bounding-box-geojson` is `{type: geo_shape, ignore_malformed: true}`, so the
dataset native-CRS bounds bug **silently drops the field** instead of failing the write;
that is why only 182/619 docs carry a bbox.

**Next** M0.2 (fail-closed auth) — nothing else is deployable until the unauthenticated
`/query` route is closed.

---

## 2026-08-07 · M0.2 · Auth fails closed; CORS scoped

**Change** `api/server.py`: `_require_agent_chat_api_key` now raises `RuntimeError`
when `AGENT_CHAT_API_KEY` is unset, unless `AGENT_CHAT_AUTH_OPTIONAL=1` is set
explicitly. Added a `require_api_key` decorator and applied it to the four routes that
had no auth at all: `/query`, `/query/batch`, `/agent/files/upload`,
`/agent/files/<id>/download`. Replaced `CORS(app)` with `CORS(app, origins=_cors_origins())`,
reading `AGENT_CORS_ORIGINS` (comma-separated) and falling back to the existing
`ALLOWED_DOMAIN_LIST` JSON array. New `rag_pipeline/tests/test_api_auth.py` (24 cases).

**Why** Two independent holes. `_require_agent_chat_api_key` returned early on an unset
key — so auth was disabled by *omission*, which is the failure mode that never shows up
in testing because the tests also omit the key. And `/query`, the full RAG pipeline, had
only two auth call sites in the whole file (`:1286`, `:1781`) and was not one of them:
it was reachable unauthenticated from any origin.

The fail-closed contract was already designed and just never implemented — the
agent-chat routes at `:1289` already catch `RuntimeError` and return
*"Server misconfiguration: API key not set"*. Making the helper raise it made the
existing handlers correct without touching them.

**Measured** Unauthenticated data-bearing routes: **4 → 0**. Wildcard CORS: **1 → 0**.
Auth tests: **0 → 24**, all passing.

`rag_pipeline/tests/` — two runs, because the environment changes the answer:
- Without `.env` (this worktree's default): 501 passed, **3 failed**.
- With the main checkout's `.env` exported: **503 passed, 1 failed** in 151s.

So two of the three were purely `Missing required environment variable:
OPENSEARCH_NODE`, not defects. The remaining failure is
`test_spatial_routing_e2e::test_spatial_routing_to_generation_e2e`, an e2e test against
real backends, in a file this change does not touch. It also failed in the pre-change
prod-pinned run recorded in M0.1.

**Surprised by** Three existing fixtures relied on the fail-open behavior:
`test_download_route.py:23` even documented it — `monkeypatch.delenv("AGENT_CHAT_API_KEY")
# no auth in test`. That is the clearest possible evidence the hole was load-bearing in
practice rather than theoretical. All three now set `AGENT_CHAT_AUTH_OPTIONAL=1`
explicitly, which is the behavior they actually wanted.

`/health` and `/agent/dashboard` are deliberately left open — the first is the container
healthcheck, the second a static HTML page with no data. Both are asserted in the new
suite so a future change to either has to be deliberate.

**Next** M0.3, the eval metric fix. Until `retrieval_success` scores against the full
expected sets, no later milestone can show an improvement.

---

## 2026-08-07 · M0.3 · retrieval_success scores the full expected set

**Change** `scripts/eval_common.py:342`: `retr` now scores against `full_exp` /
`full_cov` instead of `meta["primary_ids"]`. Added `retrieval_recall` ("N/M") and kept
the old value as `primary_retrieval_success`. `task_status` deliberately untouched, so
this change moves exactly one metric and nothing else.

**Why** `retrieval_success` was computed from a hand-picked subset of each task's
expected elements, and `full_exp`/`full_cov` were already computed on the two lines
above and simply unused. The metric therefore read "yes" on every recorded run and was
structurally incapable of registering a retrieval improvement — which is the metric all
of M1.2, M3 and M4 are supposed to move.

**Measured** Re-scoring all 11 committed records:

| | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| `retrieval_success == "yes"` | **11/11** | **5/11** |
| aggregate recall over full expected sets | not reported | **25/37 (68%)** |

Per task, worst first: T8 **2/7**, T5 1/3, T4 3/5, T1 2/3, T10 2/3, T9 4/5, then
T7 3/3, T2 4/4, T3 2/2, T6 1/1, CRIME_HEATMAP 1/1.

**Surprised by** 25/37 here versus the **22/37** BM25 figure recorded in M0.1. Both are
correct and they measure different things: 22/37 is a single BM25 query per task at k=8,
25/37 is what the full agent pipeline actually grounded on (several retrieval methods,
query refinement, and the direct sweep). Worth keeping distinct — the first is the
retrieval ceiling for one method, the second is end-to-end behavior. `scripts/eval_retrieval.py`
(M0.4) will report the first properly across methods and k.

Also: no test imports `eval_common`, so this metric had no regression net at all. The
new `retrieval_recall` field is what M1.2's exit criterion will be read from.

**Next** M0.4 — `scripts/eval_retrieval.py`, so recall@k is measurable per method
without an LLM in the loop.

---

## 2026-08-07 · M0.4 · scripts/eval_retrieval.py — the retrieval instrument

**Change** New `scripts/eval_retrieval.py`. Deterministic, no LLM: recall@k,
precision@k and MRR over the full expected sets, for arbitrary `--k` across arms
`keyword | semantic | agent_kb | union | union+agent_kb`. Union arms fuse with RRF
(k=60), matching the agent's own reranker so a union figure is comparable to what the
agent would actually see. Writes JSON with `--json`.

**Why** `run_eval_cases.py` measures end-to-end agent behavior, where a retrieval
regression can hide behind a good answer and a retrieval gain can be masked by the model
failing to use it. M1.2, M3 and M4 all claim to move retrieval, so they need an
instrument that isolates it and costs nothing to re-run.

**Measured** Baseline against the live cluster, `keyword` arm, all 11 tasks / 37 ids:

| k | recall | |
|---|---|---|
| 8 (current effective window) | **22/37** | 59.5% |
| 20 | **29/37** | 78.4% |
| 50 | 33/37 | 89.2% |
| 100 | 34/37 | 91.9% |

This **independently reproduces** the M0.1 baseline through a different code path,
which is the result I most wanted from this step — the 22/37 and 29/37 figures the whole
M1.2 case rests on are now produced by committed, re-runnable code rather than a
throwaway script.

Missed by every arm even at k=100 — genuine indexing gaps, not window problems:
`afbee4bd` (T6), `643aaea1` (T9), `de05a428` (T10). Exactly 3, matching M0.1.

**Surprised by** Two things worth keeping. First, `semantic` reports **unavailable**
rather than scoring 0/37, because `semantic_search` returns `[]` both when the embedder
is down and when nothing matched — collapsing those would have silently understated
every union arm and made the embedding outage look like a retrieval quality problem.
Second, my initial "unreachable at every k" label was wrong: it listed 8 elements when
only k=8 and k=20 had been tested, 5 of which are recoverable at k=50. Fixed to "missed
at every k *tested*", with a pointer to raise `--k` to separate a ranking problem from
an indexing gap. A metric that overstates the size of a problem is as unhelpful as one
that hides it.

Note `outputs/` is gitignored (`.gitignore:63`), so the JSON is not committed —
regenerate with:
`python scripts/eval_retrieval.py --k 8,20,50,100 --methods keyword --json outputs/retrieval_$(date +%F).json`

**Next** M0.5 — `constraints.txt`, so the dev/prod version drift stops making every
later measurement ambiguous.

---

## 2026-08-07 · M0.7 · Stop advertising a tool that cannot exist

**Change** `extractors/doc_ids.py`: `mcp_tool_name_for` now returns the real executor
name (`mcp_run_notebook_workflow` / `mcp_run_code_element`) instead of
`mcp_run_<workflow_id>`; added `run_invocation_for()` returning tool **and** argument,
since a name alone is not actionable for these executors. Both extractors' `contents`
markers changed from `[runnable: mcp_run_<wid>]` to `[workflow <wid>] … Not directly
callable; reuse the extracted functions.` `SkillSpec.allowed_tools` is now empty, and
`skill_emitter._render` emits an explicit "no single tool runs this" Run section instead
of silently omitting it. Hand-corrected the one shipped
`.agents/skills/ai-agent-for-chicago-crime-analysis/SKILL.md`.

**Why** `generic_executor_tools` registers exactly two fixed tools that take the workflow
id as an *argument*; it does not register one tool per workflow. So every
`mcp_run_nbwf_*` name ever emitted named a tool that could not exist — and one shipped
into a SKILL.md `allowed-tools` list, i.e. the model was explicitly told to invoke a
fiction. Worse, the docstring at `doc_ids.py:84` asserted the false belief
("The executor registers `run_<workflow_id>`"), so the bug was documented as intended
behavior.

The executors stay unreachable in beta regardless: `AGENT_ALLOW_WORKFLOW_EXEC` remains 0
and `generic_executor_tools` stays out of `DEFAULT_MCP_MODULES`, because the execution
body is a bare `exec()` of ingested source in the MCP server process. Hence "not directly
callable" rather than a corrected tool name — a truthful name for a gated tool would still
waste a turn.

**Measured** Emitted names that cannot resolve: **1 per promoted workflow → 0**.
Shipped SKILL.md files advertising a nonexistent tool: **1 → 0**. Suite unchanged
(501 passed, same 3 pre-existing failures).

**Next** M0.5, now materially larger — see the pyarrow finding below.

---

## 2026-08-07 · M0.5a · pyarrow is an undeclared dependency, and two geo tools are broken in prod

**Change** None yet — this entry records the finding, because it is a production defect
found while building the lock file and it deserves its own record.

**Why it matters** `pyarrow` appears in **no** requirements file, yet three code paths
call `to_parquet`:
- `agent_runtime/langchain_geo_tools.py:436` — `vector_reproject`
- `agent_runtime/langchain_geo_tools.py:476` — `vector_spatial_join`
- `extractors/geo_handles.py:42` — the GeoDataFrame file-handle mechanism (pickle fallback)

The dev machine has `pyarrow 24.0.0` from anaconda. A clean `pip install -r
requirements.txt` does not install it. So in the deployed image the two vector tools
return `{"ok": false, "error": "Missing optional dependency 'pyarrow.parquet'"}` and
`geo_handles` silently degrades to pickle — while both pass in dev.

**Measured** In a verified-isolated venv built only from `requirements.txt`:
`vector_spatial_join` → `ok: false`. That is the single extra failure in the prod-stack
suite run (**502 passed, 2 failed** vs dev's **503 passed, 1 failed**).

**Surprised by** How wrong my earlier framing was. I had recorded this as *LangChain*
version drift. It is not: the langchain triple moves nothing here. The real drift is the
scientific stack — prod resolves **pandas 3.0.5** against dev's **2.2.3** (a major
version), numpy 2.1.3 → 2.5.2, geopandas 1.1.2 → 1.1.4, and `fiona` appears from nowhere
at 1.10.1. For a geospatial platform a silent major pandas bump is a far larger risk than
a langchain minor, and neither was bounded. Also worth noting the resolver moved *within
this session*: the dry-run hours ago gave langchain 1.3.14, the real install gave 1.3.15.

**Next** M0.5 proper: add `pyarrow`, then build and *test* a constraints file rather than
freezing whatever resolves today.

---

## 2026-08-07 · M0.2b · Prototype told to match the new auth contract, verified in-browser

**Change** `examples/iguide_chat_prototype.html` and `examples/agent_chat_stream_demo.html`:
API-key label "(optional)" → "(required by default)" with a tooltip naming
`AGENT_CHAT_AUTH_OPTIONAL`; new `describeHttpError()` translating 403 / 500-misconfig /
CORS-block into actionable sentences; the upload path checks status *before* parsing JSON
(that route is now protected). New `scripts/run_agent_api_dev.sh` + a `.claude/launch.json`
entry so there is one supported way to start the API locally with the right env.

**Why** M0.2 changed the auth contract and I did not update the interface — so the
prototype still described the key as optional, and a blank key surfaced as a raw
`{"error":"Forbidden: invalid API key."}` body, which reads like a server bug rather than
a setting. A feature is not done when the server is right; it is done when the interface
tells the truth about it.

**Measured** — driven through the real prototype at `localhost:8132` against a live API on
`:5002`:

| Case | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| no key | raw JSON body | "403 — this server requires an API key. Enter it in the API key field above." |
| wrong key | raw JSON body | "403 — the API key was rejected. Check the key matches AGENT_CHAT_API_KEY on the server." |
| correct key | — | full substantive answer, 4 notebooks, 8 sources |

Server-side matrix by curl: no key 403, wrong key 403, correct key 400
`user_input is required` (i.e. past auth into the handler), Bearer token also 400,
`/health` 200.

**Surprised by** three things, in increasing order of importance.

1. `scripts/run_agent_api_dev.sh` first used `set -a; . .env; set +a`, which **clobbered
   my explicit `PORT=5002` with the file's 3500 and replaced the API key I passed**. That
   is the shell twin of the `load_dotenv(override=True)` defect the plan already flagged:
   the file beating the environment makes per-run overrides impossible and the reason
   invisible. Rewrote it to skip any key already set in the environment.
2. Driving one query exercised both blocked backends and showed the cost: the embedding
   server is unreachable (stale `.env` host) so semantic retrieval is silently absent, and
   Neo4j returns *"Unable to retrieve routing information"* before falling back to keyword.
   The agent degrades correctly, but each unreachable backend is paid for in latency —
   which is the argument for the planned `NEO4J_ENABLED=0` fast-fail.
3. **The grounding audit fired `severity: high` on a well-grounded answer.** The answer
   named four notebooks, all four present in the retrieved sources
   (A2SFCA, Pysal Access Compute Example, SPASTC, 6.02 Thematic and Reference Mapping),
   and the audit appended: *"contains a hallucinated claim about the platform offering
   several notebooks for computing spatial accessibility to hospitals."* That claim is
   exactly what the evidence supports.

   This is a **false positive at the one severity that reaches the user**, and the gate's
   own comment at `graph.py:415` says `{"high"}` exists specifically to suppress false
   positives. So the caveat now degrades correct answers in the UI. It also corrects M0.1:
   "the caveat has fired zero times" is true of the 11 recorded runs, not of the system —
   it fired on the first live query. Logged as the top candidate for M6; it is also the
   publishable negative result the planning work identified.

**Next** M0.5 — the constraints file, which turned out to hide a worse problem than pandas.

---

## 2026-08-07 · M0.5 · constraints.txt — and two real production defects it exposed

**Change** New `constraints.txt` pinning the stack the passing suite and the eval baseline
were actually produced on. Added `pyarrow` to `requirements.txt`. The three Dockerfiles
that install the root requirements (`rag_pipeline/`, `MCP_server/`,
`metadata-extraction-server/`) now `pip install -r requirements.txt -c constraints.txt`.

**Why** `requirements.txt` carries unbounded pins and both entrypoints ran a plain
`pip install`, so "the deployed stack" was whatever PyPI happened to serve that hour. The
resolution moved *inside this session*: a dry-run gave langchain 1.3.14, the real install
an hour later gave 1.3.15.

**Measured** — four clean, verified-isolated builds, same suite, same `.env`:

| Build | Result |
|---|---|
| dev machine (anaconda) | **503 passed, 1 failed** |
| clean, unconstrained | 502 passed, **2** failed — `test_spatial_join` |
| constrained, but only `langgraph` pinned | 502 passed, **2** failed — `test_history_repair_middleware` |
| **fully pinned (this commit)** | **503 passed, 1 failed — matches dev** |

The one remaining failure is `test_spatial_routing_e2e`, pre-existing and unrelated.

**Surprised by** two defects, both of which were shipping:

1. **`pyarrow` was undeclared.** `langchain_geo_tools.py:436` (`vector_reproject`) and
   `:476` (`vector_spatial_join`) write GeoParquet, and `geo_handles.py:42` uses it to move
   (Geo)DataFrames between tools. Dev had pyarrow 24.0.0 via anaconda; a clean build did
   not. So both vector tools returned
   `{"ok": false, "error": "Missing optional dependency 'pyarrow.parquet'"}` **in every
   deployed image**, and `geo_handles` silently fell back to pickle. `requirements.txt:28`
   already carried a comment about exactly this failure mode for bs4/lxml/markdownify —
   the pattern had been recognised once and pyarrow missed. Fixed: `test_langchain_geo_tools.py`
   goes **12 passed / 1 failed → 13 passed**.

2. **Pinning `langgraph` alone is not enough, and the failure is total.** Its sub-packages
   version independently: a clean build took `langgraph-prebuilt` **1.0.13** against the
   pinned `langgraph` **1.0.10**, and 1.0.13 does
   `from langgraph.runtime import ExecutionInfo` — a name absent in 1.0.10. That raises
   `ImportError` while importing `langchain.agents`, so **`create_agent` cannot be
   constructed and the entire agent is dead on arrival**, not degraded. `langgraph-checkpoint`
   (4.0.1 → 4.2.0), `langgraph-sdk` (0.3.9 → 0.3.15) and `langsmith` (0.6.7 → 0.10.18)
   drifted the same way. All now pinned.

   This reframes the whole exercise: I had been treating the drift as a *quality* risk
   (untested versions) when it also contained an *availability* risk (a clean build that
   cannot start the agent at all).

Also worth recording: `fiona` is listed in `requirements.txt` but is **not installed in
dev**, so dev reads vectors through `pyogrio` while every container gets fiona. Left as-is
for now — a divergence to close deliberately, not silently.

**Next** M0.6 — `LLM_PROVIDER` with the `claude-cli` backend, so the extraction batches
from M2 onward cost nothing.

---

## 2026-08-07 · M0.6 · LLM_PROVIDER=claude-cli (dev/experiments only) · model: sonnet

**Change** New `rag_pipeline/llm_claude_cli.py` and a five-line dispatch in
`llm_utils.call_llm:58`. `LLM_PROVIDER=claude-cli` routes to `claude -p --output-format json
--model $CLAUDE_CLI_MODEL` (default **sonnet**). `last_model()` records the model per call;
`preflight()` + `python -m rag_pipeline.llm_claude_cli` diagnose setup in one command;
`check_not_deployed()` refuses to run where `AGENT_DEPLOYED` / `KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST` /
`ECS_CONTAINER_METADATA_URI` is present. 21 tests, subprocess stubbed so they need no
credentials.

**Why** `call_llm` is where the recurring cost of this project sits — the publication
extractor runs over ~180 elements and the rerank/audit/router paths fire every turn. Routing
it through the CLI during development makes the M2–M7 batches free. It is deliberately *not*
wired into `build_default_llm()` (the agent peers): experiments should run on models
comparable to what is deployed, and using a stronger model there would flatter the eval.

**Measured** 21/21 new tests pass; suite **501 → 522 passed**, same 3 pre-existing failures.

⚠️ **BLOCKED on a credential — the backend cannot authenticate on this machine.** Both paths
were tested and both are unavailable:

| Path | Result |
|---|---|
| `--bare` (needs `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) | `Not logged in · Please run /login` — no key in env |
| no `--bare` (uses the interactive login) | `401 OAuth access token has expired. Re-authenticate to continue.` |

To unblock, **one** of:
- `export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...` — preferred: works with `--bare`, reproducible, and the
  path Anthropic's terms require for automated use; or
- run `claude` interactively, `/login`, then set `CLAUDE_CLI_BARE=0`.

**Surprised by** a real design tension in `--bare` that changes how this must be configured.
`--bare` is what makes a run reproducible — it skips hooks, plugins, auto-memory and
CLAUDE.md auto-discovery, so this repo's own instructions are not silently prepended to every
extraction prompt. But its help text states that under `--bare` "Anthropic auth is strictly
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY … OAuth and keychain are never read". **So `--bare` and subscription auth
are mutually exclusive**, and the tool itself enforces the boundary the terms describe:
scripted use wants an API key. `use_bare()` therefore defaults from the credential that is
actually present rather than being hardcoded on, and the docstring records the trade-off
(subscription = free but leaks project context into prompts; API key = costs money but is
reproducible and compliant).

Second, smaller: the CLI **exits non-zero while still emitting the JSON that explains why**.
My first version judged `returncode` before parsing, which turned "not logged in" into an
unreadable dump of usage counters. Parsing now precedes the exit-code check, and
`test_auth_failure_is_actionable_even_on_nonzero_exit` pins it.

**Next** M0.8 — `_fan_out` in `ingest_from_github`, the last M0 item.

## 2026-08-07 · M0.8 · ingest_from_github now actually emits

**Change** `extractors/ingest.py`: `ingest_from_github` calls `_fan_out(manifest, ctx.targets)`
and takes `element_id` / `dry_run`. Emitting without an `element_id` now raises rather than
proceeding. `extractors/cli.py` grows `--element-id` and `--dry-run` and reports on stderr
which targets it emitted to. `MCP_server/tools/ingest_tools.py` mirrors both, returning
`{"ok": false, "error": ...}` as data rather than raising, matching this repo's MCP convention.

**Why** `_fan_out` was called only from `ingest_submission` (the webhook). So both other
entry points — `extractors.cli` and the MCP `ingest_github_repo` tool — extracted everything
and silently discarded it, while accepting `--targets` and `--reingest` arguments that
implied persistence. The `element_id` guard exists because without it every derived doc_id
anchors on `repo_id`, seeding docs into the agent KB that no platform element can ever claim.

**Measured** Ingesting one real notebook (`cca9b545`) through the CLI:

| | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| files persisted | **0** | **3** — `agent_kb/iguide_agent_notebook_blocks.json` (6 blocks), `generated_notebook_workflows/sources/nbwf_d01e717421c1b0ff.py`, and its manifest (12 keys) |
| emit without `element_id` | silently produced nothing | refuses with an actionable error |
| `--dry-run` | did not exist (was the only behavior) | prints the manifest, emits nothing |

Suite: 522 passed, same 3 pre-existing failures.

Bonus verification: the freshly generated SKILL.md came out with `allowed-tools: []` and the
new "no single tool runs this pipeline" Run section, and **zero** `mcp_run_nbwf_*` occurrences
— so M0.7 holds on generated output, not just on the one file I hand-edited.

**Surprised by** two things this test run exposed.

1. **The skill emitter writes into the working tree.** `skill_emitter._default_root()` is
   `REPO_ROOT/.agents/skills`, so my single test ingest created
   `.agents/skills/cca9b545-.../` inside the checkout — i.e. running ingestion mutates the
   repo, and any CI or test run would dirty it. `AGENT_GENERATED_SKILLS_ROOT` overrides it,
   but the *default* being the source tree is wrong for an emitter. Cleaned up; noted for the
   M3 test work, which will need that root pointed at a tmpdir.
2. **CLI-path ingestion produces badly named skills.** The generated skill was named
   `cca9b545-8416-45a3-9267-122ce6ce9991` — the raw UUID — because `slugify(title)` had no
   title to work from: `ctx.fields` carries the platform form metadata and the CLI path
   supplies none. The webhook path gets titles, tags and authors; the CLI path gets nothing.
   That is an argument for the M2 `sources.py` work fetching the element record from
   `backend.i-guide.io` rather than relying on whoever calls the CLI to pass fields.

**M0 complete.** Next: M1.1 (persistent workspace), the first of the three ceilings.
